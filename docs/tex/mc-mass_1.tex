\chapter{Introduction}

MC-Mass is a tool for estimating aircraft mass characteristics based on the various aircraft parameters, that includes mass, center of mass location and inertia moments. It is based on the statistical equations presented in \cite{Raymer2018,NASA-TP-2015-218751}.

Aircraft parameters are used to estimate mass of various aircraft components. These components can be arranged to reflect aircraft layout so that overall aircraft characteristics could be calculated using Huygensâ€“Steiner parallel axis theorem theorem.

MC-Mass allows to estimate mass characteristics of four aircraft classes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[---] Fighter/Attack
  \item[---] Cargo/Transport
  \item[---] General Aviation
  \item[---] Helicopter
\end{itemize}

These classes varies with a set of parameters necessary for the estimation mass of components.
